# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.



This project aims to classify different types of flowers using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). CNNs are widely used for image classification tasks due to their ability to capture spatial dependencies in images.
